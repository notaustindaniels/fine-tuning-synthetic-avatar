What would the seller’s ideal buyer be?  What would their personality and demographics be like?  What would their life story have been like?  Use the seller’s product/service, as well as the above script to craft the ideal buyer for seller’s product/service.  Fill in the blanks using the seller information.  For example, the name of their offer should be used as the placeholder for “[What is the Title or Name of the product, service or software you can offer your ideal customer here?: Author Wizards]” instead of “Author Wizards”.  Also, the section of "What does it allow your customer to do?" from the seller information, should be used as the placeholder for [What does this offer element do for them? Ex: get all your content marketing and sales copy created] instead of “get all your content marketing and sales copy created”.  SPEAK IN AN INFORMAL STYLE.
