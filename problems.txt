Use the seller’s product/service, as well as the above script to craft the ideal buyer for seller’s product/service.  Fill in the blanks using the seller information.

RESPONSE:
My avatar's name is Emma.
Emma is a busy, working mom who dreams of becoming a healthier, more energetic version of herself.
Currently, Emma's focus is on finding time for fitness and wellness.
Ultimately, Emma really wants to feel confident and energized.
Right this minute, Emma would be ecstatic if she could find a simple, effective fitness routine that fits into her hectic schedule.
Unfortunately, Emma still needs to figure out how to balance her work, family life, and personal health goals.
Emma is also really frustrated by the fact that most fitness programs don't cater to her busy lifestyle.
Plus, she still needs the answer to this question before she can move forward: "How do I stay motivated and consistent with my fitness routine?"
Emma is also still hung up on the idea that getting fit requires hours at the gym or expensive equipment.
In fact, when it comes to finding time for fitness, Emma is convinced that most fitness guides actually want her to FAIL.
When all is said and done, Emma just wants to feel good in her own skin and have the energy to keep up with her kids.
To help Emma, I would invite her to check out my fitness and nutrition guide, "Fit For Life: The Everyday Woman's Guide to Health & Fitness," so she can achieve fitness goals with practical, everyday exercises and nutrition plans without feeling overwhelmed or giving up her precious family time.
